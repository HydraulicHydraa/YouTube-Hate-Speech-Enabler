# YouTube-Hate-Speech-Enabler

Are you tired of faggot Youtube deleting your comment because you said something too edgy? Spread dangerous misinfo about vaccine effacacy or black IQ?
Comitted treason by questioning the 2020 election? Supported Putin's genocide against the innocent Ukrainians by being anti-War? Spread hate against the 
LGBTQIA2S+%(*%#* community by saying pedophilia is bad? Maybe even caused a second holocaust by *GASP* said something critical of the Jews?
Well rejoice! With this simple .PY script, you too can spread your based hateful ideology to the 4 corners of the internet! Just copy your comment, 
run either the normal version or the light (increased legibility) version, paste the comment back in and voila! Instant hate speech!
(It also works if the comment is innocuous and non-TOS-violating but just happens to have a banned word in it.)

If GH deletes this, I'll repost and the Uploader thing somewhere else so stay tuned (does that apply here?) if you give a fuck!
